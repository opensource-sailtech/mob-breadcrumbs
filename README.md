# mob-breadcrumbs

Floating devices carried by crew that emit a variety of signals, not just light. 
Throw in water in case of MOB.
- crew aboard throws them to use as breadcrumbs for getting back to mob
- mob throws in water to create a larger, more easily found target
Float free. Small belt/ankle/pfd/transom pack.
Options for 
- day & night visibility techniques (light, smoke)
- audible signals
- dsc & epirb radio signals with gps

Blind helms may do best to wear the 360-degree sensory belt described by Aleef: it would vibrate in different places to indicate direction of MOB. Different types of vibration can mean different things, like location and tack of another boat

In a [Yachting World article](http://www.yachtingworld.com/expert-sailing-techniques/stay-safe-board-youre-sailing-short-handed-90432), Pip Hare recommends
"Keep a stash of light sticks in your pocket â€“ you can throw them over the side to make a trail to sail back along." The iteration explored in this repository would add other signals than just visible light.
